First thing is to determine the requirments (Rookie mistake is to start coding as soon as we have an idea of what we have to do)

Requirements:
	1. Track games played and their outcome (who won)
	2. Multiple competitor pay in the tournament (classes)
	3. Crate a tournament plan
	4. Schedules games
	5. A single loss eliminates a player
	6. The last player standing is the winner 
- This are the basics, now we need the full requirements in order to crete the app

Questions to get the full requirements:
	1.  How many players will the tournament handle? Is it variable?
	2.  If a tournament has less than the full complement of players, how do we handle it? (when instead of having for example 4 finalists, we have only 3)
	3.  Should the ordering of who plays each other be random or ordered by input order?
	4.  Should we schedule the game or are they just played whenever?
	5.  If the games are shceduled, how does the system know when to schedule games for?
	6.  If games played whenever, can a game from the second round be played before the first round is complete?
	7.  Does the system need to store a score of some kind or just who won?
	8.  What type of front-end should this system have? (from webpage, app, etc) -> (another rookie mistake is to make assumptions)
	9.  Where will the data be stored?
	10. Will this system handle entry fees, prizes, or other payouts?
	11. What type of reporting is needed?
	12. Who can fill in the results of a game?
	13. Are there varying levels of access?
	14. Should this system contact users about upcoming games?
	15. Is each player on their own or can teams use this tournament tracker?

--- Send the questions to the person that wants this app:
- Answers:

	1.  The application should be able to handle a variable number of players in the tournament
	2.  Basically, certain people selected at random get to skip the first round and act as if they won (for ex, instead of 16 we have 14)
	3.  The ordering should be random
	4.  Whatever order and whenever tha players want to play it
	5.  Not considered
	6.  No. Each round should be fully completed before the next round is displayed
	7.  Storing a simple score would be nice, just a number for each player. That way, the tracker can be flex enough to handle a checkers tournament (winner:1, loser:0)
	8.  The system should be a desktop system for now, but down the road we might want to turn it into an app or a website
	9.  Ideally, the data should be stored in a Microsoft SQL database, but please put an option to store it in a text file instead
	10. Yes. The tournament should have the option of charging an entry fee. Prizes should also be an option, where the tournament administrator chooses how much money to award a variable number of places. Teh total cash amount should not exceed the income from the tournament. A percentage-based system would also be nice to specify
	11. A simple report specifying the outcome of the games per round as well as a report that specifies who won and how much they won. These can be just displayed on a form or they can be emailed to tournament competitors and the administrator
	12. Anyione using the application should be able to fill in the game scores
	13. No. The only method of varied access is if the competitors are not allowed into the application and instead, they do everything via email
	14. Yes. The system should email users that they are due to play in round as well as who they are scheduled to play
	15. The tournament tracker should be able to handle the addition of other memebers. All members should be trated as equals in that they all get tournament emails. Teams should also be able to name their team
