Big Picture Design 
-> This gives me the idea of how to design the app

Structure: Windows Forms Application and Class Library
Data: SQL and/or Text file
Users: One at a time on one application

Key Concepts (things i might not know now)
	. Email (how do i send it from C#?)
	. SQL (how to access data)
	. Custom Events (how will i know when its the last game of the round)
	. Error Handling
	. Interfaces
	. Random Ordering
	. Texting
